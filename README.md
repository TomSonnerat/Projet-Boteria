# Projet Boteria ðŸŒ±

---

## Presentation

**Projet Boteria** is a plant tracking system designed to monitor and collect data about plants' environment. This project combines hardware and software to track various parameters such as humidity, luminosity, acidity, and more, sending data to an HTTP endpoint every hour.

---

## Features

- **Data Collection**
    - Soil humidity (3 sensors)
    - Temperature and humidity (DHT11)
    - Luminosity (BH1750)
    - Plant photo capture (ESP32-CAM)
- **Data Management**
    - Hourly data collection
    - Data transmission to a Raspberry Pi for further processing and storage
    - Accessible API for data retrieval

### Current Focus

The initial phase of the project emphasizes the **hardware aspect** to ensure robust and accurate data collection.

---

## Hardware Components

- **ESP32-CAM Module**
    - Collects and sends data to the Raspberry Pi.
    - Takes periodic photos of plants.
- **Sensors**
    - **BH1750**: Measures ambient light.
    - **DHT11**: Captures temperature and humidity.
    - **3 Soil Moisture Sensors**: Tracks soil humidity levels.
- **Power Supply**
    - Powered by a 3xAA battery pack with an AMS1117 voltage regulator (4.5V to 3.3V).

---

## Software

- **Python** for backend data processing and API development.
- **Thonny IDE and MicroPython** for ESP32-CAM module programming.

---

## Installation

1. Hardware Setup

- Assemble the sensors and ESP32-CAM module.
- Connect the power supply via the voltage regulator.
